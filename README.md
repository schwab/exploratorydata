# Exploratory Data Final

* Data plots for the Exploratory Data Analysis Class
* The code in this repo assumes that the data files "summarySCC_PM25.rds" and "Source_Classification_Code.rds" are in the current working directory.  These files were sourced from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip


## Each plot does the following
* Provides an appropriately named R file
* Provides a plot in png format
* Includes code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced

## Plot 1 answers the question :
* Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
* Uses the base plotting system
* Shows the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008

## Plot 2 answers the question :
* Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 

## Plot 3 answers the question :
* Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? 
* Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? 

## Plot 4 answers the question :
* Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

## Plot 5 answers the question :
* How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
## Plot 6 answers the question :
* Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
